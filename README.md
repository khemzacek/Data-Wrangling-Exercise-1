# Data-Wrangling-Exercise-1

Practice cleaning a messy data set.  
The data set is small, but illustrates many of the issues faced when dealing with real-world, messy data from a database. 

The data set and exercise were inspired by this blogpost: http://d3-media.blogspot.nl/2013/11/how-to-refine-your-data.html  
The exercise was created by Springboard.  
The code was written by me, Katherine.
